# Street_View_House_Number_Classification
This project utilizes artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks to identify images of numbers 0-9.
Example images:

The final model, cnn_model_2 included 12 convoluitonal layers and which fed into a basic 4-layer artificial neural network. The model has 159,978 tainable variables.

Search for "observation" and cycle through the results for a quick, high-level view of my comments as the project progresses.
